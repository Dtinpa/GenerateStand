    <li>This API allows a total of 50 requests a day, regardless of access token.</li>
    <li>When you sign up, you'll receive a client id and secret, but you will still need to be manually approved in order to make requests.</li>
    <li>I'll most likely email you if I decide to give you access.</li>
    <li>This is more of a training ground for both you the user and I.</li>
    <li>Since the data here isn't truely important, treat this as an exercise in how to interact with APIs</li>
    <li>In turn, this was a project to test the limits of my abilities so far.</li>
    <li>More Quality of Life updates will come in the future, but for now, this is enough to get started.</li>
